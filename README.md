# Stripe Testing
Added stripe integration using react-stripe-checkout, can be found here.

https://github.com/azmenak/react-stripe-checkout

Did not push dependencies, however it should just be:

npm install react-stripe-checkout

npm start (to run app)

Also pushed the app to firebase to ensure that it still works (it does).
